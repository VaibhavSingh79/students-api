# Database management API


(I'm sleepy will update it to a readable format later)
A simple Go-based API that manages data, providing endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting information.
This project leverages Postman for documentation and testing. It is designed for beginners in Go and API development, focusing on core CRUD operations.


<h2>Features </h2>
Add new   records.
Retrieve all   details or a specific  's data.
Update an existing  ’s information.
Delete a   record.
Includes Postman examples for easy testing and integration.

Utilize Postman’s built-in features to view examples, authentication settings, and environment variables associated with the API collection 1 2 5 10 .
Example: Testing with Postman
Open Postman and import the collection.
Run a POST request to add a  .
Execute a sequence of API calls to form a workflow, such as adding a  , retrieving their details, then updating and deleting them.
